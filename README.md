# Data Science Portfolio

## 👋 Welcome to My Data Science Journey

Hi! I'm an aspiring data scientist enrolled in the MCA program at {place_holder} university (session 2024-2026). I'm passionate about data science, machine learning, and building intelligent systems. This portfolio showcases my learning projects and experiments in Python, data analysis, and AI. While I'm still building my expertise, these repositories reflect my hands-on exploration of various data science concepts and tools.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Data Science Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, NLP, Clustering (DBSCAN)
- **Web Development**: Flask (for ML model deployment)
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Jupyter Notebooks, LangChain, Embeddings
- **Data Handling**: CSV processing, Text analysis, Dataset exploration

## 📊 Projects

### 🤖 Chatbot Development
- **[chatbotx/](chatbotx/)**: Implementation of conversational AI chatbots using Python. Includes versions 2.0 and 2.1 with data-driven responses from CSV files. Explores basic NLP and dialogue systems.

### 🌍 Data Science Explorations
- **[datascienceGFG/](datascienceGFG/)**: Collection of Jupyter notebooks covering data science fundamentals:
  - Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis of India
  - NumPy tutorials and operations
  - Data reading from files (text processing)
  - Working with real datasets like adult census data and mushroom classification

### 📱 Spam Classification Web App
- **[NOU-Project-2023/](NOU-Project-2023/)**: A Flask-based web application for SMS spam detection. Features a machine learning model trained on the SMS Spam Collection dataset, with a clean UI for real-time predictions.

### 🧪 Playground Experiments
- **[playground/](playground/)**: A sandbox for various data science experiments:
  - **chatbot_semantic/**: Semantic chatbot using embeddings for better context understanding
  - **dbscan/**: Implementation of DBSCAN clustering algorithm with Euclidean distance calculations
  - **embedding/**: Experiments with text embeddings and vector representations
  - **langchain/**: Integration with LangChain for building LLM-powered applications
  - **tensorflow/**: Introduction to TensorFlow for deep learning basics

### 📚 Machine Learning Learning Path
- **[python-ml-learning/](python-ml-learning/)**: Ongoing projects and exercises in machine learning algorithms, model training, and evaluation techniques.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project includes its own README with setup instructions. Most require Python 3.x and can be run locally or in Jupyter environments.
